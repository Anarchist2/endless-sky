I recognize that look on your face - it's the same one I had after my first job like this back when I was a beginner. If I recall, my first priority after touching down was replacing some of the ship's guns with missile launchers so I'd actually have a chance against pirates. It's a scandal how they sell interceptors with nothing but short-ranged energy weapons these days; trying to use them in combat on such a small ship is practically suicide. Keep your distance with some missiles and you can almost never go wrong. Anyway, I'll stop rambling. If you've still got a hankering for some dangerous missions, come and find me in the spaceport before you leave." He picks up his suitcase and heads outside.`
